We have developed a website that will show price prediction based on land size, land location, no of bedrooms and bathrooms in Bangalore.

### Technologies Used

* Python as Programming Language
* Pandas for Data Cleaning
* matplotlib for Data Visualization
* sklearn for Model Building
* HTML, CSS & JS for Frontend
* Flask for Backend Server

## Project Description

I have built a Real Estate Price Prediction using fundamentals of Data Scicence and Machine Learning like
Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, One Hot Encoding, Outlier Detection, Dimensionality Reduction, and Model Evaluation.
I have implemented a Linear Regression Model to predict the Real Estate Price. 

The Project has a Website Made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as frontend and a Flask Server as backend where inputs are taken and predictions are made.

In the Website the User Must Enter Required Area Value in sqft.Select BHK and Bathroom values.
